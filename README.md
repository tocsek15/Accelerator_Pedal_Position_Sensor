# Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor

The Accelerator Pedal Position Sensor is a fictional thesis project by Zoltan Torma.

## Abstract

The central theme of the dissertation is the presentation of a software development workflow on both a theoretical and practical level, with the intention of providing a comprehensive view of these workflows to software engineering aspirants pursuing their university studies or graduating from university.
The theoretical part of the dissertation presents the tools, methodologies and standards that are essential for these security-critical software development projects following the V-model path. Naturally, in this case, the language and operation of the project should also be discussed, which will also be presented in this section.
In the focus of the subsequent case study, the process of developing a module with a detailed description is presented within the framework of a fictitious project, thus helping to understand the theoretical part. The relevant requirements, the related documentation, and the configuration of the development tools I use are also presented here.
At the end of the essay, the dissertation concludes with my own conclusions.
